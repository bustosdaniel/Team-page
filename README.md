# Responsive Design with CSS Grid and MUI (Material-UI)

This is an example of how to create a responsive web design using CSS Grid and MUI (Material-UI). The provided code includes CSS styles and React components to achieve a card layout with information about a creative team.

## CSS Styles with CSS Grid

In the CSS code, a `.card-element-style` rule is defined that uses CSS Grid to create a layout with 3 columns and 2 rows. This is accomplished with the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. A gap between cells is also set using the `gap` property.

The `overflow-y` property is set to `visible` to allow content to flow freely without vertical restrictions.

## React Components with MUI

In the React code, MUI is used to create responsive components. The `App` component contains a header with a title and subtitle, and the `Cards` component displays a list of card elements using MUI's `ImageList`. Each card includes an image, a title, and a name.

The card layout is customized using inline styles in the `ImageListItem` component, including title rotation for a unique appearance.

This example demonstrates how to combine CSS Grid and MUI to create a responsive and visually appealing web design. You can adapt this code to your own needs and content.
